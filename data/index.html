      <div class="about2">
        Mini Minecraft is the final project for CIS 460 (Introduction to
        Computer Graphics), where students work in groups of three to create a
        miniature version of Minecraft. The project is completed over the course
        of 3 milestones, each a week or so long, and in each one new features
        must be added. In the final week, all non-mandatory features are
        added.<br /><br />
        This webpage shows my group's progress working on the project.
